# Quiz-Using-Web-Api

I want to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions using everything I have learned so far from the bootcamp.  This means that this app will run in the browser and have dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.  This needs to be clean, polished, and have responsive user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
